Description: This package provides a tool set for searching RDF graph data 
  through SPARQL and data mining. The functions for SPARQL query are designed 
  to be executed on RDF data stored in AllegroGraph and/or Openlink Virtuoso.
  Also, in order to support the construction of domain ontologies, 
  this package proposes a methodology for extracting target domain concepts from 
  a large-scale public Linked Open Data (LOD) system. 
  The method allows to obtain the class-related hierarchy of the domain concept 
  by the occurrences of common upper entities and the chain of those path relationships
  using LOD, especially Wikidata.
Depends: R (>= 4.0.0), SPARQL
