Description: In recent years, there has been an increase in RDF (Resource Description Framework) compliant databases.
  This package provides a tool set for searching RDF graph data and data mining. 
  This package proposes a methodology for extracting target domain concepts from 
  a large-scale Linked Open Data (LOD) system. 
  This method allows us to obtain the class-related hierarchy of the target domain concept 
  by the occurrences of common upper entities and the chain of those path relationships
  using Wikidata and other RDF data.
